**Harmful Algal Bloom Assessment of Lake Okeechobee System (HALO)**
The HALO portal is a comprehensive sensing and information visualization package aimed to combat Florida freshwater eutrophication, harmful algae proliferation, and ultimately protect human and ecosystem health. We are augmenting existing State of Florida monitoring programs by expanding ambient and ground water water quality and biological measurements with  **innovative HAB detection and environmental characterization technologies**, as described below. Our aim is to pinpointing problem areas *prior to* -or early during- a Lake Okeechobee harmful algal bloom (HAB) emergence. The  **HALO system**  (Harmful Algal Bloom Assessment of Lake Okeechobee)  is a in-development web-based platform for visualizing Lake Okeechobee freshwater HAB bloom intensities and extents, as well as results of environmental characterization and modeling. The multi-faceted approach will provide the necessary data to improve our overall knowledge of the triggers underlying HAB formation, toxin generation, and bloom senescence. 

**Biogeochemical Modeling (ROMS-NPZD)**

We are developing a coupled 4-Dimensional (i.e. Latitude, Longitude, Depth, and Time) physical-biological model for Lake Okeechobee based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System ([ROMS](https://www.myroms.org)). The model will include both hydrodynamic and biogeochemical components that capture the fundamental physical-biogeochemical processes in the lake while taking into account the external forcing including freshwater inputs and outputs through the rivers and canals, and meteorological forcing. The objective is to use the model to provide prototype operational forecast of water quality and phytoplankton blooms in the lake.

**Machine Learning Model**

**David Wilson, davidwilson2016@fau.edu**
We are developing a Machine Learning Model to predict M. *aeruginosa* surface blooms based on current and recent environmental conditions. The Machine Learning approach is unique and relies on high computing power to develop predictions based on artificial intelligence and pattern recognition. The Machine Learning Model features (inputs) will consist of recent (days to weeks) and current environmental, geochemical, and/or biological data (including HAB conditions), and the model will output the likelihood of occurrence and intensity of near-future (days to weeks), spatially resolved, M. *aeruginosa* bloom.

**Environmental Monitoring and Sample Collection (including HAB and Toxin Identification and Characterization, and Metabolic Measurements)**
**Malcolm McFarland, mmcfarland@fau.edu**
Repeat visits during the non-bloom and bloom season will provide opportunities for collecting biological samples for innovative, comprehensive algal sampling beyond what is already being performed by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). In addition, visits will collect environmental and optical data used to characterize the living environment of the organisms. Both surface and bottom samples are planned to provide a better illustration of full water column processes, also important from the Project-wide emphasis on the role of internal loading (e.g. sediment nutrient and toxin fluxes) and the role of water column conditions on bloom formation. Five monitoring sites with 3 relative “Tiers” of importance are located at points representing the N/S/E/W and center of the lake. The single Tier 1 site has a mud bottom, is in the north of the lake and will be used for most of the sampling and measurement activities. In Tier 2, two additional sites with sand and peat sediments will be examined. Finally, in Tier 3 monitoring at two more mud bottom sites will start to provide full lake coverage.

**Load Mapping and Diffusive Flux Characterization, sediment Algal Cysts, and Sediment Algal Toxins**
**Lynn Wilking, lwilking@fau.edu**
Sediment spatial inventories of carbon, nutrients, and their respective benthic fluxes will be quantified. Microcystis aeruginosa cyst resting stages in the sediment will also be quantified, and toxin concentrations of microcystin will be measured as well. During each field survey, sediment cores from Tiers 1, 2, and 3 sites will be collected (five sites total during each survey), the sites together comprehending several bottom types (3 x mud, 1 x sand, 1 x peat).

**Benthic Lander Deployments**
**Jordon Beckler, jbeckler@fau.edu**
**Jessica Carney, jcarney@fau.edu**

A benthic lander package will be deployed in conjunction with sediment core collections to collect in-situ biogeochemical measurements. Over a 6-48 hour period the lander will obtain direct in-situ measurements of carbon, nutrients, and sediment redox profiles, as well as water quality data such as salinity, temperature, chl-a, FDOM, and DO

**Autonomous Spatial Monitoring via Surface Vehicle (NAVOCEAN)**
**Scott Duncan, scott@navocean.com**
In-situ environmental, biogeochemical, and physical data will be collected with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). The ASV will be configured to detect the presence of HABs and is expected to survey an area of NW Lake Okeechobee, but may be redirected to other areas where emerging HABs are suspected.

**Remote Sensing and SeaPRISM Monitoring**
**Tim Moore, mooret@fau.edu**
Remote sensing data products will be generated from Sentinel-3 data streams. Raw satellite data will be processed and used with several bio-optical algorithms producing turbidity, chl-a concentration, and the cyanobacterial index.

**Kristen Davis, ksande14@fau.edu**
**Haley McQueen, hmcqueen@fau.edu**
Biogeochemical Instrument Packages (BIPs) are being installed at critical sites for the initiation of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Okeechobee and will continuously monitor temperature, conductivity, depth, DO, pH, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, turbidity, CDOM, phosphate, and nitrate on an hourly basis.
